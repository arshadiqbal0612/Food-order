When a React component loads, the constructor is called first, initializing the component's state and props. Then, the render method is invoked, which returns a React element to be displayed on the DOM. Once the component is mounted, it fetches data from APIs or performs any necessary setup in the componentDidMount lifecycle method.

As data is retrieved, the component's state is updated, triggering a re-render. This is where componentDidUpdate comes into play, allowing us to perform additional actions based on state changes or other updates.

When navigating away from the page or unmounting the component, componentWillUnmount is called, giving us the opportunity to clean up any resources or subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.

Understanding the lifecycle of a React component is crucial for building efficient and robust applications.

useEffect Execution: After the initial render, the useEffect hook is executed. Since the dependency array is empty ([]), the useEffect callback function will only run once after the initial render. This ensures that the effect is performed after the component has been initially rendered to the DOM.
